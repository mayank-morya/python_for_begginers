Object-oriented programming (OOP): Understanding the concepts of classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism can be difficult for beginners, as they can be abstract. OOP is a powerful programming paradigm that allows for the organization and reuse of code, and is widely used in many Python libraries and frameworks.

Example:
```
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed
    def bark(self):
        print("Woof!")

my_dog = Dog("Fido", "Golden Retriever")
print(my_dog.name) # "Fido"
my_dog.bark() # "Woof!"
```
Decorators: Decorators can be difficult to understand because they involve the manipulation of function objects and closures. Decorators are a powerful feature of Python that can be used to add functionality to existing code, and are commonly used in Python frameworks and libraries.

Example:
```
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_whee():
    print("Whee!")

say_whee()
```
Generator expressions and yield: Understanding generator functions and objects, which are a powerful and memory-efficient way to work with large data sets, can be difficult because they involve the use of iterators and the creation of custom iterable objects.

Example:
```
# generator function
def my_gen():
    n = 1
    print('This is printed first')
    yield n

    n += 1
    print('This is printed second')
    yield n

    n += 1
    print('This is printed at last')
    yield n

# using for loop
for item in my_gen():
    print(item)
```
Multithreading: Multithreading can be difficult to understand because it involves managing multiple threads of execution simultaneously, which can be challenging to coordinate and synchronize.

Example:
```
import threading

def worker():
    """thread worker function"""
    print(threading.get_ident())

threads = []
for i in range(5):
    t = threading.Thread(target=worker)
    threads.append(t)
    t.start()
```
Exception handling: Exception handling can be difficult to understand because it involves managing and responding to errors and unexpected conditions in code, which can be complex and nuanced.

Example:
```
try:
    x = 1 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print("Error Code:", e)
```
Regular expressions: Regular expressions can be difficult to understand because they involve a specialized syntax and language for pattern matching and text manipulation, which can be complex and difficult to read.

Example:
```
import re

string = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.search("^The.*Spain$", string)

if x:
  print("YES! We have a match!")
else:
  print("No match")
```
Async/await: Async and awaitcan be difficult to understand because they involve the use of non-blocking I/O and concurrency, which can be challenging to coordinate and synchronize.

Example:
```
import asyncio

async def my_coroutine():
    print("My coroutine")

await my_coroutine()
```
Functional programming: Functional programming can be difficult to understand because it involves a different way of thinking about programming, using concepts such as immutability, first-class functions, and closures.

Example:
```
from functools import reduce

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = reduce(lambda x, y: x*y, my_list)
print(result)
```
Meta-programming: Meta-programming can be difficult to understand because it involves the manipulation of code at runtime, which can be complex and abstract.

Example:
```
class MyMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        x = super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)
        x.attribute = "example"
        return x

class MyClass(metaclass=MyMeta):
    pass

obj = MyClass()
print(obj.attribute)
```
Network programming: Network programming can be difficult to understand because it involves the use of sockets and protocols for communication over networks, which can be complex and abstract.

Example:
```
import socket

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.bind(("127.0.0.1", 3000))
s.listen()
```
